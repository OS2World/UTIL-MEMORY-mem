The MEM utility
===============

Users of OS/2 are sometimes unsure about the amount of memory that OS/2
is actually "seeing"; some BIOSes may mis-report the amount of memory to OS/2,
resulting in OS/2 not actually using available memory.

MEM is a small program that just asks OS/2 how much memory it thinks there
is, and reports the answer. There are no parameters required.
A typical run might be:

   [E]mem
   Physical memory seen by OS/2: 159MB + 640KB

That's all there is!
